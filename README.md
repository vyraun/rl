# rl
Library with implementations of different reinforcement learning algorithms

Implemented:
* Deep Q learning (implemented with target network and experience replay)
* Simulated annealing

Todo:
* Genetic algorithm (in repo but not yet finished)
* TRPO (trust region policy optimization)
* CEM (cross-entropy method)
* Advantage learning

# Error
When I ran: python examples/runner_lunarlander.py 
I got error: ImportError: No module named rl.algorithms.deepq
